# Powershell-Spells
A place for any Powershell "spells" that I find useful.

This is just me learning powershell but much of what I have here is something I actually use so code away! 

DiagnosticMaster is a useful tool for troubleshooting PCs. It pulls information and runs all the normal upkeep stuff you'd want to run on a PC. 

Holiday Countdown & Function prompt is one that I use a modified version of for my powershell profile so that whever I start up Powershell, it displays the dates for me and adjusts my prompt.

Install Microsoft Powershell Module installs all of the Microsoft Modules I would normally want installed.
